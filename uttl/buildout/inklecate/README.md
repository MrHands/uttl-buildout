`always-install` (optional)

Set this option to 1 to skip checks for missing installed files and always run the script.

`output-dir` (optional)

Directory where the files are built to. Defaults to the current directory.

`artefacts` (optional)

Additional list of files that will be installed by the recipe but are not picked up automatically.
