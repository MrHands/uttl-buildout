# uttl.buildout.cmake

Executes commands using a CMake build script, to e.g. to generate a Visual Studio solution or build an executable.

The recipe will track files that were generated by running the command, including when you run an `install` target.

## Configuration Options

  Path to the executable used to run CMake commands. You don't need to set this if the executable was added to the system-wide PATH environment variable.

``generator`` (optional)

  Specifies the generator used by CMake when configuring the build environment. Example: `Visual Studio 2017 15 Win64`

``configure_path`` (optional)

  Path for the output of the CMake configure step. If you are generating a Visual Studio solution then this is where it will be generated to.

``build_path`` (optional)

``target`` (optional)

``config`` (optional)
