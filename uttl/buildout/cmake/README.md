# uttl.buildout.cmake

Executes commands using a CMake build script, to e.g. to generate a Visual Studio solution or build an executable.

The recipe will automatically keep track of files that were generated, including when you run an `INSTALL` target. Only when the output was deleted will the command be run again.

## Configuration Options

``executable`` (default: "cmake")

Path to the executable used to run commands. You don't need to set this if the executable was added to the system-wide ``PATH`` environment variable.

``always_install`` (optional)

Set this option to 1 to skip checks for missing installed files and always run the script.

``artefact_path`` (optional)

Manual tracking for the path to the artefact generated by CMake. While the script will automatically parse the output and track files that were generated, this option can be useful to ensure that commands are run again when the output was deleted.

``generator`` (optional)

Specifies the generator used by CMake when configuring the build environment, e.g. ``Visual Studio 2017 15 Win64``.

``configure_path`` (optional)

Outputs the CMake configure step to the specified directory. For example, when you want to generate a Visual Studio solution then this is the folder where it will be generated to.

``build_path`` (optional)

Builds the ``CMakeList.txt`` configuration at the specified path, which will output files to the directory specified with the configure step.

``install_path`` (optional)

Sets the variable ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` to this path.

``target`` (optional)

Target(s) to build from the generated environment using the specified generator.

``config`` (optional)

Configuration to build from the generated environment using the specified generator.

## Example

Downloads the SDL2 library and builds a release DLL for Windows using Visual Studio 2017.
